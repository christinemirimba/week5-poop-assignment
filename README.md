# WEEK5 POOP(Python  Object-Oriented Programming) Assignment

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- `assignment1.py`: Implements encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism using a `Car` class and an `ElectricCar` subclass.
- `Polymorphism.py`: Demonstrates polymorphism with different vehicle types (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) using a shared `move()` method.

---

## Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation (`_` and `__` attributes)
- Inheritance (`ElectricCar` inherits from `Car`)
- Polymorphism (method overriding and dynamic method dispatch)

---

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).

### Run `assignment1.py`

```bash
python assignment1.py

### Run `Polymorphism.py`
```bash
python Polymorphism.py
